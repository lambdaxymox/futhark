Futhark is a purely functional data-parallel programming language in
the ML family.  It can be compiled to typically very efficient
parallel code, running on either a CPU or GPU.  The language and
compiler are developed at [DIKU](http://diku.dk) at the University of
Copenhagen, originally as part of the [HIPERFIT
centre](http://hiperfit.dk).  The language and compiler are quite
stable and suitable for practical programming.

We try to make use of GitHub issues for organising our work.  Issues
tagged with
[good first issue](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
do not require deep knowledge of the code base.
